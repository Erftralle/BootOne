# BootThree
Responsive Layout for JoomGallery based on Bootstrap 3.x.

### Note
This is work in progress and far from being finished. Please provide feedback, any comments or suggestions are welcome!

This layout is optimized for Bootstrap 3.x which is currently ***not*** shipped with Joomla! 3.x by default. If your template uses Bootstrap 2.x (the default of Joomla! 3.x) please have a look at https://github.com/JoomGallery/BootOne/tree/master instead.

### How to use
- Download the zip archive of this repository and install it via the extension manager of Joomla.
- Go to the menu manager and change the menu item(s) of JoomGallery from the default layout to the ```Bootstrapped``` layout.
- If all other views (linked from these menu items) should use the bootstrapped layout as well go to the configuration manager of JoomGallery and set the option 'Frontend Settings' -> 'General Settings' -> 'Alternative Layout' to ```bootone```.
